# Survey Pro  
Survey Pro is a native-integrated field survey and inspection app.  
It uses device-native features for writing, photo capture, GPS tagging, and reporting — all managed through a lightweight architecture.

## Current goals
- Build first UI mock-up (home screen).
- Define project → floors → rooms → issues structure.
- Connect with GitHub Codespaces for development and testing.
